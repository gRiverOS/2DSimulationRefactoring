The architectural view of a software development cycle is centered on the design of the application or system and how the design drives the development. Basically, there are five phases of architecting are as follow: 1. Predesign phase 2. Analysis phase 3. Schematic design phase 4. Design development phase 5. Building phase


different interests can be explained and analyze using the following established views: 1. Management 2. Software Engineering. 3. Engineering design


The methods have this early focus because they are architecture-centric techniques, and architecture is the blueprint for a system

Once a project is in implementation, testing, deployment, or maintenance phase, the architecture has been largely decided on, either explicitly or implicitly
